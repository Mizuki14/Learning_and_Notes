This is instruction manual to demonstrate how to set SSL certificate to use https

I'm using Rasberry Pi 4B running Ubuntu 20.04, if you are using different OS, process might be different

1: Add public IP address and domain name in /etc/hosts 
  Example 101.101.101.11 google.com 
          101.101.101.11 www.google.com
          
2: Create configuration file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ 
  Example [here] (https://github.com/Mizuki14/Learning_and_Notes/blob/main/Basic%20Setup/example.com)

3: Go to website you purchased the domain from and add A record
    Example: If you purchased from [Namecheap] (https://ap.www.namecheap.com/)
    - navigate to Domain List on left hand side
    - Click the Manage button, then go to Advanced DNS
    - click on ADD NEW RECORD 
    - Select A, host [Your domain], ip address [Your public IP address], then click the check button
 
 ! Repeat the process but this time add www instead of your domain
 
 4: Install snapd
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install snapd
   
   Install certbot 
   sudo snap install --classic certbot

  Issue certtificate (If you are using apache2)
  sudo certbot --apache
